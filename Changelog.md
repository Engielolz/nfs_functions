Version 1.3.1
===========

This version is a hotfix to add support for Minecraft 1.21 as the Build System is not ready yet

* Supports Minecraft 1.21. Differences in this version:
  * Removed Combat Snapshot settings
  * Removed legacy RNG. /random is now always used
  * Food entries from 1.14 onwards merged into the main foodcheck file
* The version of NFS that runs on older versions of Minecraft also reports as 1.3.1, but does not have the above changes
